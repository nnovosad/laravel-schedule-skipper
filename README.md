# Laravel Schedule Blocker

**Disables Laravel scheduled commands in the local environment.**

This package automatically prevents any scheduled tasks from being executed when your application is running in the `local` environment. Ideal for development, when heavy scheduled jobs can slow down your work or interfere with testing.
